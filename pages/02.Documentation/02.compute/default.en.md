## Overview

SysEleven Stacks Compute Service is built on the OpenStack Nova project.

It manages the life-cycle of compute instances in your environment. Its responsibilities include spawning, scheduling and decommissioning of virtual machines on demand.

You can manage your compute instance both via our public [OpenStack API](../../03.Tutorials/04.api-access/default.en.md) endpoints, as well as using the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cloud.syseleven.net).
